                <p class="article__text first-paragraph">This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was
                    travelling.
                    About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The
                    locomotive,
                    slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too
                    great. The buffaloes
                    marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of
                    interrupting them,
                    for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a
                    torrent of living flesh
                    which no dam could contain.
                </p>
                <p class="article__text">The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but
                    Phileas
                    Fogg, who had the most
                    reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should
                    please
                    the buffaloes to get out of the way.
                    Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of
                    revolvers
                    upon them.
                </p>
                <p class="article__text">"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a
                    procession, just as if they were
                    not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his
                    programme!
                    And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"
